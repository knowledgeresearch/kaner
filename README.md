# Introduction
**KANER** (*Knowledge-Aware Named Entity Recognition*) is a toolkit with various knowledge-enhanced NER models to facilitate the development, experiment, and test of these models. It provides a library of machine learning modules and the pipeline for training models.

# Getting Started
## Setup Environment
**KANER requires Python 3.6.0 or above.**

```bash
virtualenv ./env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API references

### Quick tour
Let's do a quick tour of KANER. If you want to train a model, you need to type the following command:

```bash
python app.py train --cfgpath "./configs/blcrf.yml"
```

If you have trained a model on the dataset and want to do some case studies to check the model's performance, you can use our service module that provides an online REST API to debug your model. More details can be found in the tutorial [service](./docs/tutorials/service.md).

Additionally, we provide a series of notebooks (see [notebooks/](notebooks/)) that include various experiments and data analysis.


# Build and Test
## Test
We use [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to help us to test this project. You need to run the following command for testing this project:

```bash
pytest ./tests/
```

## Build
The following command helps you to build a package. The detailed tutorial can be found in [Packaging Projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
